genome_privacy
==============
These are codes for my semester project concerning secure computation of genomic similarity.
The cryptographic scheme used here includes Paillier and DGK schemes, both of which need two independent servers, i.e. main server and proxy server.
There are two versions. The first version concerns unpacked scheme implementation of similarity computation.
And the second version concerns scheme with packing, which means to reduce the computation and communication overhead.
